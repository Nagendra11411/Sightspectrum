<p>Starbucks Corporation is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington. It is the world's largest coffeehouse chain.

As of November 2021, the company had 33,833 stores in 80 countries, 15,444 of which were located in the United States. Out of Starbucks' U.S.-based stores, over 8,900 are company-operated, while the remainder are licensed.[3]

The rise of the second wave of coffee culture is generally attributed to Starbucks, which introduced a wider variety of coffee experiences. Starbucks serves hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Depending on the country, most locations provide free Wi-Fi Internet access.</p>

<p>Café Coffee Day Global Limited Company is a Chikkamagaluru-based business which grows coffee in its own estates of 20,000 acres.[5] It is the largest producer of arabica beans in Asia, exporting to various countries including U.S., Europe, and Japan.[6]

V. G. Siddhartha started the café chain in 1996 when he incorporated Coffee Day Global, which is the parent of the Coffee Day chain.[7] The first CCD outlet was set up on July 11, 1996, at Brigade Road, Bangalore, Karnataka. It rapidly expanded to other cities in India, with more than 1,000 cafés open across the nation by 2011.

In 2010, it was announced that a consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts would invest ₹1,000 crore (equivalent to ₹19 billion or US$240 million in 2020) in Coffee Day Resorts, owned by the company.[8] The same year, the logo was changed to the current logo, which the company stated was to showcase the chain as a place to talk.[9] This was done with major changes in the layout of the stores, including the addition of lounges and a total revamp of the interiors</p>
